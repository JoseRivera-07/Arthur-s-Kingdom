            I am Merlin, born of prophecy and shaped by the ancient forces that whisper through the world.
            Long before Arthur took hold of the sword that would define his destiny, I had already seen
            his future written in the strands of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I watched him grow in secret, unaware of the royal blood within him. When the moment arrived,
            I guided him to the stone where the sacred sword awaited. With a humble heart and a pure spirit,
            he drew the blade effortlessly, fulfilling the destiny only he could claim.
        </p>
        <p>
            From that day onward, I served as his mentor and advisor. I taught him to listen beyond words,
            to lead with compassion, and to trust those who would later stand with him at the Round Table.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arthur became a beacon of hope, a king whose greatness came not from power, but from honor.
            And as long as people believe in courage, justice, and unity, the legend of King Arthur will
            never fade.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I tell this tale, as Merlin the Wise, keeper of magic and witness to the rise of a true king.
