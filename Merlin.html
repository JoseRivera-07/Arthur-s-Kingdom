            <h2>As Told by Merlin</h2>
            <p>
                I am Merlin, born of prophecy and shaped by the ancient forces that whisper through the world.
                Long before Arthur took hold of the sword that would define his destiny, I had already seen
                his future written in the strands of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I watched him grow in secret, unaware of the royal blood within him. When the moment arrived,
                I guided him to the stone where the sacred sword awaited. With a humble heart and a pure spirit,
                he drew the blade effortlessly, fulfilling the destiny only he could claim.
            </p>
            <p>
                From that day onward, I served as his mentor and advisor. I taught him to listen beyond words,
                to lead with compassion, and to trust those who would later stand with him at the Round Table.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arthur became a beacon of hope, a king whose greatness came not from power, but from honor.
                And as long as people believe in courage, justice, and unity, the legend of King Arthur will
                never fade.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I tell this tale, as Merlin the Wise, keeper of magic and witness to the rise of a true king.
            </p>
