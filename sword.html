            “In the days of great turmoil in the kingdom, the Sword of Destiny was forged under the guidance of the wise Merlin.<br>
    The steel was tempered not only with fire and hammer, but with arcane words spoken in forgotten tongues..<br>
    When the page was complete, the wizard called upon higher powers to bless it and seal its purpose.<br>

    Thus, it was placed on the Sacred Stone, where it was bound by an enchantment impossible to break by mortal hands.<br>

    The sword would not respond to force or pride, for its brilliance was destined only to reveal the true ruler.<br>
    Those whose hearts were stained with ambition would feel the weight of the world when they touched it;
    but the worthy, those whose spirits were upright and pure, would find the blade as light as the dawn.<br>

    And so she remained, motionless and silent, awaiting the chosen one whom the ancient prophecies had foretold.”

        <summary><b>1</b>The sword in the stone is NOT always Excalibur.</summary>
            <div class="container-2">
                In many medieval versions, the sword in the stone and Excalibur are not the same weapon.
                Arthur pulls the first one out of the stone... and later receives Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake.

        <summary><b>2</b>The spell tested character, not strength</summary>
        <div class="container-2">
            The spell cast by Merlin was designed to measure purity, humility, and destiny, not physical power.
            That is why even the strongest knights failed.

    <details>
        <summary>3<b></b>Merlin does not control the sword after enchanting it.</summary>
        <div class="container-2">
            Once the spell was cast, not even Merlin could remove the sword, for its magic responded only to the chosen one.
