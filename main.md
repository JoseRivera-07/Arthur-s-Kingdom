## Brief explanation (2–4 lines) of how they organized the work with branches

_We divided the work into sections. We chose the story of King Arthur and assigned parts: one person worked on the story of King Arthur, another on the sword in the stone, another on the round table, another on Merlin the wizard, in addition to the person who created the main page and the person who wrote the README.md. Each part was developed in a different branch to avoid conflicts._
