## Brief explanation (2–4 lines) of how they organized the work with branches

- We divided the work into sections. We chose the story of King Arthur and assigned each part: one person worked on the story of King Arthur (Jose Rivera), another on the Sword in the Stone (Danna Oyola), another on the Round Table (Sergio Ospina and Valentina Duque), another on the wizard Merlin (Samuel Vanegas), as well as the person who created the main page (Jose Rivera) and the person who wrote the README.md (Danna Oyola). Each part was developed in a separate branch to avoid conflicts.
