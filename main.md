## Name of the world

**THE ARTHUR'S KINGDOM**

## Brief description of the world


-This project was created with the idea of bringing the story of the Knights of the Round Table to life in a visual, simple, and engaging way. Through a set of interactive cards, each knight reveals their image and story when flipped, offering an experience that blends curiosity, design, and a touch of medieval magic.
The main goal was to learn and practice HTML and CSS concepts—especially 3D effects, custom styling, and responsive design—while also enjoying the creative process: choosing warm colors, old-style fonts, and golden details that reflect the essence of Camelot.
More than just a web page, this project is a small tribute to the legends that continue to capture our imagination, and an opportunity to grow as a developer while building something that looks good and feels meaningful.
