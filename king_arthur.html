    <section id="Him-history">

        <p>
            I am Arthur Pendragon, though I was not born a king.
            In my youth, I lived as a simple ward, unaware of my bloodline. Britain was fractured then—lords fighting lords, people desperate for unity.
            Everything changed the day I touched the sword in the stone.
            <br><br>

            Where countless knights had failed, the blade rose for me as if it had been waiting.
            Only then did I learn the truth: I was the son of Uther Pendragon, rightful heir to the throne.
            <br><br>

            Under the guidance of Merlin, I gathered the bravest men of the realm and forged the Round Table, a place where no knight sat above another.
            I ruled with Excalibur, gifted by the Lady of the Lake, a weapon that reminded me that power without virtue is hollow.
            <br><br>

            Together, my knights and I faced beasts, treachery, and the endless struggle to keep peace in a kingdom still learning to hope.
            Yet my greatest battles were not fought with steel, but with the hearts of those I trusted.
            <br><br>

            The love between Lancelot and Guinevere, my closest friend and my queen, fractured what we had built.
            And my own blood—Mordred—would rise against me, delivering the blow that ended my reign.
            <br><br>

            As I fell, I was carried to Avalon, where legends say I rest still. Some believe I will one day return when Britain needs me most.
            Perhaps that is my true legacy: not the crown I wore, but the dream of a better kingdom that refuses to die.
            <br><br>
